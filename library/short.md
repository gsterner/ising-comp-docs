Using a virtual Ising Machine to do Monte Carlo simulations
===============================================================

Abstract
--------

There has recently been work done in building physical realizations of the pure Ising Model. At the same time there has been significant development in the research around which algorithms can be solved by the Ising Model. These have mainly focused on optimization and NP-complete problems. Here, another use is proposed.
